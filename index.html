      <h2 id="top5">Top 5: <em>It All Began with Loneliness</em> - The Anchoret</h2>
      <img src="images/anchoret.jpg" alt="It All Began with Loneliness by The Anchoret Album Cover" width="500"
        height="500" />
      <blockquote>The Anchoret is a Progressive Metal project that combines prog rock sensibilities with modern metal
        energy.</blockquote>
      <p>What made me like this album is the seamless blend of flutes, saxophone, with the heavy and melodic guitar
        riffs. Additionally, the transitions between heavy and soft are perfectly blended to give space and let the
        music breathe.</p>

      <h2 id="top4">Top 4: <em>Would You Miss It</em> - Koyo</h2>
      <img src="images/koyo.jpg" alt="Would You Miss It by Koyo Album Cover" width="500" height="500" />
      <blockquote>Koyo is a Melodic Hardcore band with hints of Emo. They are from Long Island NY.</blockquote>
      <p>This album is the first that I've heard from the band. Considering that it is their debut album, it is a strong
        opener to their discography. The melodic hardcore riffs pleasantly scratches my Emo itch.</p>

      <h2 id="top3">Top 3: <em>Skinwalker Social Club </em> - MOSSBACK</h2>
      <img src="images/mossback.jpg" alt="Skinwalker Social Club by MOSSBACK Album Cover" width="500" height="500" />
      <blockquote>MOSSBACK is half of the duo GRIM SALVO, which is an Experimental Rap & Hip-Hop with Acoustic and Metal
        fusions.</blockquote>
      <p>This is the first album released by MOSSBACK, and with the quality of music that they produce in GRIM SALVO, I
        had high expectations when I started listening to this album and well... it definitely exceeded my expectations
        and I listen to it regularly. It definitely has the same vibes as the ones that they did with GRIM SALVO but the
        prominence of acoustic guitar and otherworldly ambiance of this album makes it different from their duo work.

      <h2 id="top2">Top 2: <em>Divine Inner Tension </em> - Hail The Sun</h2>
      <img src="images/hailthesun.jpg" alt="Divine Inner Tension by Hail the Sun Album Cover" width="500"
        height="500" />
      <blockquote>Hail The Sun is a California-based Post-Hardcore and Progressive Rock Band, their genre is also mostly
        coined 'Swancore'.</blockquote>
      <p>This is the latest album from their discography and in my opinion, their best album to date. The singing is
        outright phenomenal and the lyrical themes are very relatable. The choruses are catchy and sing-a-long-able.</p>
      <p>The album cover is from the band's Record Label. <a

      <h2 id="top1">Top 1: <em>Take me Back to Eden </em> - Sleep Token</h2>
      <img src="images/sleeptoken.jpg" alt="Take me Back to Eden by Sleep Token Album Cover" width="500" height="500" />
      <blockquote>Sleep Token is a UK-based Progressive Metal band that is notorious for having the band members'
        identity private. Each member is called 'Vessel'.</blockquote>
      <p>Upon the drop of the first single, 'Chokehold', I knew that this album would top my list in 2023. The album is
        full of heavy sections, and genre bending compositions from rap, heavy metal, black metal, and even funk. A
        great album and a must listen from start to finish.</p>
      <p>The album cover is from the band's website. <a href="https://www.sleep-token.com/">Sleep Token - Website</a>
